    <h1>The Origin of The Pythagorean Theorem</h1>
    <span class="block">
      <p>One of the most famous mathematical principles the Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the longest side, in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides as represented by a^2+b^2=c^2. Although the theorem is named after ancient Greek Polymath Pythagoras, new evidence suggest that this theorem existed before him with civilizations such as the Babylonians and Egyptians employing its concepts. Pythagoras is renowned for articulating this principle leading to its association with his name. The theorem itself has been proved in a variety of methods by mathematicians throughout history, demonstrating its enduring significance into modern times, a topic we will discuss more soon.</p>

    <h2>The Pythagorean Theorem Proof</h2>
    <span class="block"
      <p>Even though there are several proofs for the Pythagorean theorem, the proof put forth by Euclid in Proposition 47 of Book I in "Elements" stands out as the most renown proof. This particular proof is distinguished for its utilization of geometric constructions rather than algebraic manipulations. Starting with an angled triangle and constructing squares on its sides Euclid introduces lines to create congruent triangles and parallelograms. Through a series of deductions involving these shapes properties, he illustrates that the squares area on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. This elegant proof is one of the many ways that validity of the theorem is confirmed.</p>

    <h3>Modern Day Application of The Pythagorean Theorem</h3>
    <span class="block"
      <p>The Pythagorean Theorem is necessary for our everyday lives. We use it subconciously in daily navigation when we need to find the shortest path from point A to point B. The theorem is also integral for architecture and construction. Architects can use the theorem to determine lenghs of sides on their structures in order to determinewaht parts to use. In addition, the theorem is used for maintaining structural integrity in buildings. Navigational technology also uses the Pythagorean Theorem profusely. The basis of this technology is built upon the Pythagorean theorem. Imagine taking a lay over flight instead of a direct flight to save time. It doesn't make any sense. The use of this ancient theorem demonstrates its timeless relevance.</p>
