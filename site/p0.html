    <h1>The Origin of The Pythagorean Theorem</h1>
    <span>
      <p>One of the most famous mathematical principles the Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the longest side, in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides as represented by a^2+b^2=c^2. Although credited to Pythagoras recent findings suggest that this theorem existed before him with civilizations such as the Babylonians and Egyptians employing its concepts. Pythagoras is renowned for articulating this principle leading to its association with his name. The theorem itself has been demonstrated in a variety of methods by mathematicians throughout history, demonstrating its enduring significance and universal applicability.</p>
