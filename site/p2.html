    <h1>The Ancient Art of Trigonometry</h1>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Trigonometry plays a pivotal role in our understanding of shapes, angles, and space. This ancient subject has been around for over 4,000 years and continues to be added onto even now. Similarly to many geometric principles, Trigonometry was heavily studied by the Greeks, and its name comes from the Greek word: “Trigon.” Trigonometry was constantly being built upon whether it was by the Muslims during the golden age or the Europeans in the Scientific Revolution. Mathematicians such as Johannes Kepler used trigonometry in order to create the laws of planetary motion. In modern times, trigonometry has become a dreaded topic for high school students to learn, but its universal applicability will aid students in any endeavor of their choice whether it be computer science, physics, or chemistry. Its real life applications will be explored even further in a later paragraph.</p>

    <h2>Exploring The World of Trigonometry</h2>
    <div class="block">
      <p>I have introduced to you all about where Trigonometry comes from, but you may still be asking yourself: what is trigonometry? Trigonometry is the study of the functions for angles and their application in calculations. Trigonometry has 3 main functions: sine, cosine, and tangent. These functions have their inverses as well cosecant, secant, and cotangent respectively. Usually trigonometry is introduced to high school students as functions used for right triangles. In a right triangle, sine is the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse, cosine is the adjacent angle over the hypotenuse, and tangent is the opposite side over the adjacent side. With the knowledge of one side and one angle, these functions can help you uncover all the information of that triangle. As you advance to algebra, you go beyond the scope of right triangles. You learn to utilize trigonometric functions on any angle you want. To do this you must transfer the angle to the origin on a plane with one side on the x axis and the other side coming out of the x axis clockwise. From there you can make a unit circle and then a unit hypotenuse triangle. The sine values represent the y value in the plane and cosine represents the x value in the plane. With this, sine and cosine aren’t limited by 90 degrees and can go beyond their original use.

    <h3>Its Importance to The World Today</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Out of all the subjects I have covered today, trigonometry is likely the most important to modern day society. Trigonometry has applications in many subjects spanning engineering, physics, astronomy, and chemistry. In chemistry, trigonometry can be used to find the shape of molecules. VSEPR models of molecules use trigonometry to find the lengths between molecules which allow you to determine its shape. In physics, trigonometry can be used to calculate trajectories and many other important physics stuff. Astronomers use trigonometry to find the lengths between celestial bodies and calculate their speeds too. Trigonometry is a versatile tool for many professionals and lays a foundation for the math that supports society on a daily basis.</p>
