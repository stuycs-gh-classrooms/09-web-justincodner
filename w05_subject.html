  <h2>Pyhthagorean Theorem</h2>
  <p>Developed by the Greek mathmatician Pythagoras, the pythagorean theorem allows us to find the hypotenuse  of a right triangle with the equation a^2+b^2=c^2 where a and b are legs of the triangle and c is the hypotenuse. We use this theorem subconciously everyday when we want to find the shortest route to a destination because an addition of this theorem is that c>a+b. Our modern day society can thank Pythagoras for developing this theorem which is so essential to our everyday life </p>
